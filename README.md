# spiderToKukaHand
Engineering school project to make a Kuka Hand that can detach itself and act like a spider robot 

##Kuka control
In order to control the kuka we used the KST kuka toolbox for the LBR7 https://github.com/Modi1987/KST-Kuka-Sunrise-Toolbox/
It worked like a charm.

##Files
The result you see in the video is from the folder "finalResult", the folder "spiderRobot" contains the code controlling the robot with the board OPENRB and dynamixel motors.
The folder "kuka_joystick" controls the kuka robot using an Xbox gamepad.
The folder "tests" contains some other in between programs I made in order to develop the functionalities.
The folder "3dFiles" contains the files to 3d print the spiderRobot.
